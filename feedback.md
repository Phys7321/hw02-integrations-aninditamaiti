I think that you have a little more work to do. Look through some documentation on contour plots - those will get you the best pictures of the electric potential. Right now, I don't think you're capturing much of the behavior of the potential or the fields. You may want to also look at the documentation for numpy.grad - that will allow much smoother calculations of the fields once you have the potential.

Very thorough coding job. I think you covered all the bases, though I would like to see you combine the quiver and contour plots in your python script.
